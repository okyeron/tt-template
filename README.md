# Terminal Tedium pd template

Work in progress

Based on the organelle "mother" patch and a few others, this sets up audio inputs and outputs from the Terminal Tedium along with adc.

MIDI I/O is included as well, but MIDI-out is just echoing MIDI-in for the moment (so it will light up buttons on my controllers).
